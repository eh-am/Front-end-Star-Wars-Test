# StarWarsTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.6.

## Running it

It should be pretty simple. `npm install` then `ng serve`. It should be up at `http://localhost:4200/`

## Disclaimer

This was my first try with Angular2, I haven't fully grasped all the concepts, pardon for my non-elegant code :)
